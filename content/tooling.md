# Tooling

## Philosophy

I want to get things done, and I don't want to get lost in unecessary bs. Do lots of things, do them nicely.

I don't want to have windows moving around. I want to know where my things are.

## Basics

### Operating System/Distribution
The superior [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). If you have doubts, go check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bsNIdYw5Ak) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb2iA28ditc).
### Terminal
I use st (simple terminal) by [suckless.org](https://suckless.org/). It's one of the most minimal and yet customizable terminal emulators. I have it slighly patched.
### Shell
Bash.
### Window Manager/Desktop Environment
DE's are yuck. I use [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org/) and [dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/).
### Text Editor/IDE
I'm a bit of a pleb here. I use **vim** as a text editor, but I also use vscodium (VSCode without Microsoft telemetry snitching on your every move). Might go [full vim mode](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-p5XmQHB_JSTaEPygu1DZjuFfb704Uv7) someday.
### Web browser
Firefox. While it is free software, it comes with a multitude of trackers and annoying stuff. A custom user.js file is required to remove all the trash and allows to customize the browser to make it both usable and private. I also use the following addons:
* uBlock Origin
* Decentraleyes
* DarkReader
* Unhook
* I still don't care about cookies
